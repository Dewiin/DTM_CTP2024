# [BlemishBot: AI-Powered Acne Detection](https://blemishbot.streamlit.app/)
![Logo](page_images/homepage.png)

## Introduction
BlemishBot aims to provide fast treatment suggestions for various acne conditions. We want people to gain clarity about their skin conditions, and we want them to get a general understanding of what treatments they can expect to start using. BlemishBot is **NOT** perfectly accurate, and it is **NOT** intended to replace professional consultations. For transparency, we actively encourage users to seek professional treatment from dermatologists. 

## Features
* **Image-Based Detection:** Detects and classifies 6 acne types: 
  - papules
  - pustules 
  - nodules 
  - blackheads
  - cysts
  - acne scars

* **Chatbot Support:** BlemishAI provides general skincare advice and answers to user queries.
* **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly web interface for image uploads and chatbot interaction.
* **Custom Training:** The model is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset to ensure high accuracy.
